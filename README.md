# Professional-Portfolio
The title of this Project is: Professional-Portfolio. The reason why this project is so important is becasue it will showcase all of my work to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS: If you click on the 'about', 'work' or 'contactme' buttons at the top right of the page on the nav bar, you are brought to the corresponding section within the page. This makes for easier page accessiblility to a new person navigating the website.

In the ABOUT section, you are greeted with an introductory paragraph about my work experience and how it will be useful to prospective employers. This also includes a professional-looking profile picture.
