# Professional-Portfolio
The title of this Project is: Professional-Portfolio. The reason why this project is so important is becasue it will showcase all of my work to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS: If you click on the 'about', 'work' or 'contactme' buttons at the top right of the page on the nav bar, you are brought to the corresponding section within the page. This makes for easier page accessiblility to a new person navigating the website.

In the ABOUT section, you are greeted with an introductory paragraph about my work experience and how it will be useful to prospective employers. This also includes a professional-looking profile picture.

In the CONTACT section, you are brought to a nav bar at the bottom of the web page which includes clickable links to Github, Linkedin, and my resume. It also includes my phone number and e-mail address in order to contact me.

This website is also a responsive layout so minimizing the size to a tablet, iphone, or other standard phone device will still cause it to have a proper layout. Here is an example of what the layout looks like on an iPad air:

METHODOLOGY:
I used Bootstrap 4.3.1 CSS on my wep page. Bootstrap already includes responsive layouts which helped greatly to ensure that my website is properly formatted on all standard devices. The columns, which would be anything labeled col in the html, have responsiveness built in already. Additionally, I made the images clickable to the deployed application is because it would showcase my knowledge of HTML and usage of the HREF element.
